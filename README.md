# About inventory:
This inventory of atmospheric emissions was developed for four industrial sectors in Brazil (crude oil refining, cement production, pulp and paper, and electricity generation) using a bottom-up approach for the period 1990 to 2022. The analysis includes a comparison with data from the global EDGAR inventory, an assessment of emission factors, spatialization, and the development of R code for automation, updating, and use in air quality models. Estimates are made based on EPA and EEA guidelines, and the results show that the southeast region concentrates the highest emission rates, with emphasis on the electricity generation sector, whose particulate matter emissions exceed those of the EDGAR road transportation sector. The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the cement, pulp and paper, and electricity generation sectors, while the refining sector was less affected. This project provides a robust tool for air quality management in Brazil.

# Available Files:
This folder “Brazil-industrial-emissions-inventory” consists of files in csv format with emission data for the 4 industrial sectors inventoried. The files EPA_CIMENTO.csv, EPA_PEC.csv, EPA_REFINARIA.csv and EPA_TERMELETRICAS.csv contain the name of the emitter, geographic coordinates and identification of each emission source. In addition, it includes the emission for a lower and upper limit and the average between them for PST, PM10, NOx, CO, NMVOCs and SOx, in Gg/year for the base years 1990 to 2023.
